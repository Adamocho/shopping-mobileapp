# shopping-mobileapp (Orders with SQLite)
Created as a part of a semestrial assignment

## Installing
- Copy the project to Android Studio and install it on any Android device (sorry IPhone users)
- The min SDK is set to 27 (Android 8.1). Feel free to experiment.

## Usage
- login or register (min 5 chars username & password)
- start using the app (It really has no real life usage, but It was a fun project nontheless)

## The Future
- *Maybe* update the SettingsActivity **(I'm sorry professor, expanding this feature wasn't obligatory, so, I didn't do it... I know, I know... I'm lazy :D)**
- Add dark theme
